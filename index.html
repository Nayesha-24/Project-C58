     <h1> About</h1> 
    <div class="container">
    <p> I am a student of Class 7 , and I am 12 years old. Now, I have a lot of things to read. But apart from that, I read a lot of novels and comics in my free time.Reading is a really good hobby,as it improves your concentration, grammar, and makes you passionate towards other people.I mostly like to read fiction and mystery novels.You need to be determined to finish a book.You also start have different feelings towards the characters, according to the condition they are in. Reading keeps one busy and happy.It is a good source of knowledge,employment,inspiration and appreciation.
